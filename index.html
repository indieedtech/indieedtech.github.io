Hi ;)

I researched about abandoned GitHub Pages and found your site!

contact me indieedtech@pascalchristen.ch to get back your domain or just remove the CNAME pointing to indieedtech.github.io :D

Greetings Pascal

Sadly you don't have any MX records so there was no way I was able to contact you!
